# 📝 Daily Notes

## 📅 Day 1 – Python Revision
- Revised core data types like `int`, `float`, `str`, `list`, `tuple`, `set`, and `dict`.
- Practiced string slicing (e.g., `[::-1]` for reversing) and list operations like sum and average.
- Learned how to use `.get()` in dictionaries to avoid key errors while counting character frequency.
- Performed set operations — `union`, `intersection`, and `difference` to handle unique values.
- Applied conditionals (`if-else`, `nested if`) to determine number sign, comparisons, etc.
- Practiced both `for` and `while` loops, including `break` and `continue` statements.
- Implemented simple problems like FizzBuzz and number summation using loops.
- Explored list comprehensions to write cleaner and more efficient loops.

## 📅 Day 2 – Functions & OOP
- Created user-defined functions with:
  - **Default arguments** for optional parameters.
  - **Keyword arguments** for clarity and reordering.
  - **Lambda functions** for one-line expressions.
  - **Recursion** to solve problems by breaking them into smaller sub-problems.
- Understood the importance of **modular coding** using functions for reuse and clarity.
- Explored **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
  - Defined **classes** and created **objects**.
  - Used `__init__()` constructor to initialize attributes.
  - Applied **inheritance** to extend existing classes.
  - Practiced **encapsulation** by keeping class data secure and using methods to access it.
- Realized how OOP helps in structuring complex programs in a logical and reusable way.

### 📅 Day 4 — Maths & Combinatronics

**Problem 1: Prime Number Check using Recursion**  
✅ Implemented a recursive function to check whether a number is prime.  
📎 Key logic:
- Base case: return True if n == 2
- If divisible by current `i`, return False
- If `i*i > n`, then it is prime
- Else, recursively check next `i + 1`

**Problem 2: Sieve of Eratosthenes Algorithm**  
✅ Efficiently found all prime numbers up to `n` using Sieve of Eratosthenes.  
📎 Key logic:
- Use a boolean array to mark primes
- Start from `p = 2` and mark all multiples as non-prime
- Continue till `p*p ≤ n`
